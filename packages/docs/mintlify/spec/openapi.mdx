title: "OpenAPI"
description: "Already have an OpenAPI? No problem."

To use an OpenAPI description with Fern, all you have to do is add it to your API Definition folder.

```yaml
fern/
├─ fern.config.json
└─ api/
  ├─ generators.yml #
  └─ definition/
    └─ openapi.json # <---
```

If you run `fern check` then fern will validate the OpenAPI. If no errors are surfaced, you can use Fern's generators.

## Convert to a Fern Definition

If you'd rather write a Fern Definition instead of OpenAPI, then you can run a one-time conversion.

```bash
npm install -g fern-api
fern init --openapi <path to openapi>
```
