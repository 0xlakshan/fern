title: "OpenAPI"

To use your OpenAPI, all you have to do is add it to your API Definition folder.

```yaml
fern/
├─ fern.config.json
└─ api/
  ├─ generators.yml #
  └─ definition/
    └─ openapi.json # <---
```

If you run `fern check` then fern will validate the OpenAPI. If no errors are surfaced, you can use Fern's generators.

## Convert to a Fern Definition

If you'd rather write a Fern Definition instead of OpenAPI, then you can run.

```bash
npm install -g fern-api
fern init --openapi <path to openapi>
```

Think of this as a one-time import from OpenAPI into Fern.
