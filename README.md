# Fern TypeScript Generators

This repository contains the the [Fern](https://github.com/fern-api/fern)
TypeScript generators:

- `fern-api/fern-typescript-node-sdk`
- `fern-api/fern-typescript-browser-sdk`
- `fern-api/fern-typescript-express`

Every Fern generator is written in the language it is targeting, to make it as
easy as possible for the community to contribute. As such, all these generators
are implemented in TypeScript.

## What is Fern?

[Fern](https://buildwithfern.com/docs) is an open source toolchain for
generating code for REST APIs. The input is an API description - either an
OpenAPI/Swagger spec, or a [Fern Definition](https://buildwithfern.com/docs/definition).
